//never lose readiblity
//never lose good naming
//never lose never nesting
//write readable code understandable without comment
//seperate data and logic (aka.single responsibility)
//!!write very easy to refactable and reusable code!!
//Refactoring and Reusable example : add 2 player mode, add Restart, add draw(Coin is not fliped. It stands.)

Main(){
    Player player =  new player();
    Player computer =  new player();
    Coin coin =  new coin();

    Game game = new Game(player, computer, coin);

//start : Run Game step by step
    game.start();
    game.end();

   //Which one should I choose? static start? or make instance and start?
   //Decision : make instance because I will use states of the game.
   
   //After game ends.
